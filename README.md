An exploration of what it looks like to build a frontier training framework — by actually building one.

This is not a production system or a library. A from-scratch study of the design decisions, tradeoffs, and systems behind real training infrastructure. Every module is an opportunity to try different approaches and develop informed opinions.

Measurement is built into everything. Synthetic data before real data. Rust where it helps, Python where it doesn't, and numbers to tell the difference.
